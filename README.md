# CoinGame_GUI
A Java Swing-based GUI for the classic Australian coin game "Two-Up". This program is an extension of an initial console implementation. 

Features of this app enable users to:

- Add and remove players.

- Place and remove bets on coins.

- Spin coins graphically. 

The spinner will automatically spin their coins once all players have placed their bets and individual points will be deducted/increased after doing so. If a player loses all their points, they will be eliminated. The summary panel is constantly updated after each player turn so users can keep track of their scores and results, and a toolbar at the bottom displays the state of various aspects of the game that are prone to change.
